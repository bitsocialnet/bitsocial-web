# pw-session.sh — shared resource lock for playwright-cli browser sessions.
#
# Playwright disables normal background throttling, so a hidden page keeps
# doing rendering and network work after a check finishes. Agents verifying in
# parallel therefore stack whole browser engines on one machine. This wrapper
# permits one active Playwright browser at a time and records who holds it.
#
# The lock is machine-wide, not per-repository: the contended resource is RAM and
# CPU, so every checkout that ships this script shares a single slot. Set
# PLAYWRIGHT_RESOURCE_LOCK_DIR to isolate a lock (tests, or a deliberate second
# slot on a machine with headroom).
#
# Liveness comes from `playwright-cli list --all`, which reports `status: open`
# for a running browser. A lock whose recorded session is no longer open is
# stale, and is reclaimed automatically rather than blocking every later
# workflow. When playwright-cli cannot be queried the lock is left alone, so a
# broken CLI never silently disables the budget.
#
# PW_SESSION_POLL_SECONDS overrides how often `--wait` re-checks the slot.

Usage:
  ./scripts/pw-session.sh open [--wait[=SECONDS]] <session> [playwright-cli open arguments...]
  ./scripts/pw-session.sh close <session>
  ./scripts/pw-session.sh status
  ./scripts/pw-session.sh release <session>

One browser slot is shared by every worktree and repository on this machine.

  open     Acquire the slot, then start the browser. Exits 75 when the slot is
           held by a live session; --wait polls until it frees (default 300s).
           A slot whose browser is gone is reclaimed automatically.
  close    Stop the named browser, then release the slot. Always attempts the
           browser close, even when the lock was already lost, and never
           releases a slot held by a different session.
  status   Report the holder and whether its browser is still running.
  release  Drop a lock without closing a browser. Normal cleanup uses `close`.
